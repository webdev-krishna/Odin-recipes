    <h3>Key Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Safron - </strong>primary ingredient in gulab jamun </li>
        <li><strong>Cardamom - </strong>make sure to use ground cardamom</li>
        <li><strong>Rose - </strong>Gulab means rose, so a hint of rose is necessary! I would recommend to taste it to ensure it is strong enough.</li>
        <li><strong>Khoya/Mawa - </strong>this is key! I used frozen khoya/mawa from the Indian store. Remember to put it out to defrost and crumble/whisk to give it a finer texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Gulab jamun and rose petals - </strong>both are optional, but you can mix in pieces of gulab jamun and rose petals into the mixture per your liking.</li>
        <li><strong></strong></li>
    </ul>
