    <h3>Key Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Safron - </strong>primary ingredient in gulab jamun </li>
        <li><strong>Cardamom - </strong>make sure to use ground cardamom</li>
        <li><strong>Rose - </strong>Gulab means rose, so a hint of rose is necessary! I would recommend to taste it to ensure it is strong enough.</li>
        <li><strong>Khoya/Mawa - </strong>this is key! I used frozen khoya/mawa from the Indian store. Remember to put it out to defrost and crumble/whisk to give it a finer texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Gulab jamun and rose petals - </strong>both are optional, but you can mix in pieces of gulab jamun and rose petals into the mixture per your liking.</li>
        <li><strong></strong></li>

    <h3>Tips On Making The Ice Cream</h3>
    <p><strong>Whipping the heavy cream: </strong>keep the heavy cream in the coldest part of your fridge and do not take it out until you are ready to use it. Additionally, it helps to use a cold bowl and cold whisk when whipping the heavy cream. If possible, keep it in the fridge before using.
        <br>
        <strong>Don't over mix the ice cream mixture: </strong>You whip the heavy cream to give lift to the ice cream mixture. So, try to gently fold in the condensed milk and other ingredients. Mixing lightly with a spoon.
        <br>
        <strong>Garnish:</strong> Rose petals make a beautiful garnish. Gulab jamuns cut in half look pretty as well!
